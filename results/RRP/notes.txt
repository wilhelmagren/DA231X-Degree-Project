subjects: [2, ..., 12]
recordings: [0,1,2,3]
window_size = 5s
tau = 5
gamma = .5
n_samples = 256
batch_size = 32
channels = [MEG2032, MEG2033]
emb_size = 100

PREPROCESSING:
    - cleaned data (ICA artifact removal)
    - zscoring (channel-wise & window-wise)

train/valid split = 70/30

n_conv_chs = 8
dropout = .25
learning rate = 5e-4
weight decay = 1e-6
epochs = 20

NOTES:
    - no clear separation in data prior to training, whereas there is clear separation based
	on some labels after training (e.g. eo-ec, con-psd, and reco)
    - training looks good, validation scores follows training while not being better.
