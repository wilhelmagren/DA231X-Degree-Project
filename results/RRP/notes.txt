subjects: [2, ..., 12]
recordings: [0,1,2,3]
window_size = 5s

gamma = .5
n_samples = 256
batch_size = 32

PREPROCESSING:
    - cleaned data (ICA artifact removal)
    - zscoring (channel-wise & window-wise)

train/valid split = 70/30

n_conv_chs = 8
dropout = .25
learning rate = 5e-4
weight decay = 1e-6
epochs = 20

NOTES:
    - no clear separation in data prior to training, whereas there is clear separation based
	on some labels after training (e.g. eo-ec, con-psd, and reco). Most notable is 
	probably that for 'tsne_post_reco.png' there is overlapping for the eyes-open classes,
	but eyes-closed are clearly separated from the rest. Potentially because they subject
	is tired, and having the eyes closed leads the subject to want to sleep? (Potentially
	more theta waves, if I'm not mistaken...)
    - training looks good, validation scores follows training while not being better.
